# Degrees of Freedom (DF) is a concept that appears in many statistical calculations, and it refers to the number of values in a calculation that are free to vary. In simpler terms, degrees of freedom tell us how much "flexibility" we have in a statistical calculation before we lock down all of our values.
# 
# Here‚Äôs an analogy: Imagine you have three friends, and the average of their ages is 20. If I tell you the ages of two of the friends, you can automatically calculate the age of the third one, right? That‚Äôs because two values are free to vary, but the third one is locked by the fact that their average must be 20. In this case, there are 2 degrees of freedom.

```

```{r}
# A Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a specific data point (
# ùë•
# x) is from the mean (
# ùúá
# Œº) of a distribution. It can be positive or negative:
# A positive Z-score means the data point is above the mean.
# A negative Z-score means the data point is below the mean.
# A Z-score of 0 means the data point is exactly at the mean.
# 
# t_results <- t.test(uptake ~ Type, data=CO2.chilled.250)
# t_results
# t = 6.2075, df = 3.8818, p-value = 0.003782
# alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Quebec and group Mississippi is not equal to 0
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  10.05213 26.68120
# library(car)
# The values are safe for the hypothesis because they do not go outside the lines.
# qqPlot(uptake ~ Type, data = CO2.chilled.250)
# If the sample sizes are less than 30, you need to check whether the underlying populations are normally distributed. This can be visually assessed using a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot).
# A Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of the sample data to the quantiles of a normal distribution. If the points on the Q-Q plot fall approximately along a straight line, this suggests that the data are normally distributed.

```

```{r}
# ANOVA Test
# Why do we use ANOVA?
# 
# Imagine you have three or more groups (for example, different teaching methods) and you want to know if they all have the same effect on students‚Äô test scores. ANOVA helps you check if the average test scores for each group are different.
# If you just compare two groups, you could use a t-test. But when there are three or more groups, an ANOVA is more efficient because it can compare all the groups at once.
# How does it work?
# 
# ANOVA splits the variation in the data into two parts:
# Within-group variation: How much the values differ within each group.
# Between-group variation: How much the group averages differ from each other.
# The test compares these two variations to see if the differences between groups are bigger than what would be expected by random chance.
# What do the results tell us?
# 
# p-value: If the p-value is small (usually less than 0.05), it means at least one group is different from the others.
# If the p-value is large, it means that any differences you see in the group means could be due to random chance, and the groups are not significantly different from each other.
# What ANOVA doesn‚Äôt tell you:
# 
# ANOVA tells you that there‚Äôs a difference, but it doesn‚Äôt tell you which groups are different. To find that out, you need to run further tests (called post-hoc tests).
```

```{r}
# Tests for Normality

# [t test](tTests.html)

# One Sample T-Test:Standard Dev is unknown and we have one group.
# 
# Paired T-Test: Two groups are paired and we are comparing the means of the two groups. Length-width*3 created a new column.   pretest-posttest, same group with links like marriage.
# 
# Independent sample T-test: Two groups are independent and we are comparing the means of the two groups. Different classes, no direct relationship between the two. Variables don't depend on each other.

# [Wilcoxon](WilcoxonTest.html)

# Wilxocin Signed Rank Test: Nonparametric version of one sample t-test. If the data is not normally distributed, we use this test. ANd Paired T-test is used when the data is normally distributed. If it's a low sample it'd be a nonparametric test.
# 
# Mann-Whitney U Test:Nonparametric version of independent sample t-test. If the data is not normally distributed, we use this test.

# [ANOVA](ANOVA.html)

# One-Way ANOVA: Three or more groups extension of the independent samples t test.
